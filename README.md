# d2info

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/squeek502/d2info.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/squeek502/d2info)

d2info is a tool for viewing/outputting various information about a running Diablo II game (by reading the memory used by the game).

Currently, it provides the following information:

- Experience per minute over different time periods:
  - Real time (since the character was first seen by the d2info process)
  - In-game time (only includes time that the character is in a game)
  - Current game
  - Last game (xp/min of the last game at the point of save+quit)
- Estimated time until the next level, using the various exp/min readings

Supports Diablo II verisons 1.11, 1.11b, 1.12, 1.13c, 1.13d, 1.14c, and 1.14d

## Installation

Simply grab the [latest .exe build from the releases page](https://github.com/squeek502/d2info/releases/latest) and run it.

### Running using Lua

- Build [memreader](https://github.com/squeek502/memreader), [sleep](https://github.com/squeek502/sleep), and [luafilesystem](https://github.com/keplerproject/luafilesystem) and make the resulting .dll's available to Lua's `package.cpath`.
- Run `lua d2info.lua`

## Output

The information is output to both the console window and to individual text files (in the directory `output`, relative to d2info) to allow the info to be easily added to stream overlays.

Console output example:
```
